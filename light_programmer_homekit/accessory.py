"""HomeKit accessory definitions — per-light + whole-system reachability.

Every light light-programmer manages gets a Contact Sensor named
"Communication to <light>", plus one system sensor named "Light Programmer".
The polarity is inverted on purpose: a *reachable* light reads as **Opened**
(communication is open) and a lost one as **Closed**, so Apple Home's fixed
notification text — "<accessory name> Opened/Closed" — reads naturally.
